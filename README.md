# docuchat
 
This repository is an example of how you can build a chatbot that runs on-device (uses a consumer CPU only, and doesnt need a high-end one) and lets you chat with your documents.
 
## Setting up the environment

First create your environment:

python -m venv env_docu_chat

Activate it:

Activate the environment .\env_docu_chat\Scripts\activate

And install the requirements:
